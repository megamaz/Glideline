How To Use
Welcome to Glideline! Some quick tips on using this:
Copy the game state from Studio and paste it into the left box, select your preferred optimization method, and hit optimize.
It is recommended that you add `Wind: {Level.Wind}` into your CustomInfoHUD. Wind will affect the result of automated path finders.

Here's how each method works:
- Optimized Pullup: Simply generates the inputs to pull-up with the best speed retention.

- Automated Wiggle: Requires the target to be set. 
    Tries a bunch of different wiggle patterns and outputs the best one(s). Use the dropdown on the right to select between one that gets to your target earlier, or with more speed.
    **Quick disclaimer that this algorithm is only good for long, horizontal distances with no obstrusions. If you want to gain height, this algorithm isn't really built for this, and you should stick to manual wiggles and optimal pullups.

- Manual Wiggle: Uses the wiggle data you set to generate a wiggle (wiggles between holding 90 and optimized pull-up.)
    The offset controls how far into the wiggle cycle you start.

- Agent Wiggle: Uses an agent training method over several thousand iterations in order to find a theoretically optimized wiggle path. This is relatively complex and has many parameters that can heavily affect the final output.

A wiggle is a quick alternation between holding a horizontal input to preserve speed, and a vertical input to change your direction. It's more optimal than holding a single direction, since you only lose speed on every other frame.
